# Description

A tiny Javascript application, backed by local storage, for collecting various kinds of quotes.

The app takes advantage of handlebars.js templates and jQuery UI. The MVC architecture is based heavily off of [this article](http://www.alexatnet.com/content/model-view-controller-mvc-javascript) from Alex @ Net.
