# Description

A tiny Javascript application, backed by local storage, for collecting various kinds of quotes. See a demo version [here] (http://lilianne.nfshost.com/quoteboard/).

The app takes advantage of handlebars.js templates and jQuery UI. The MVC architecture is based heavily off of [this article](http://www.alexatnet.com/content/model-view-controller-mvc-javascript) from Alex @ Net.
